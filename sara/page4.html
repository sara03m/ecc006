    <TD><h5>The Exorcist</h5></TD>
    <TD bgcolor="008b8b"> <p>(born August 29, 1935, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.), American film director who was best known for The French Connection (1971) and The Exorcist (1973).

While a teenager, Friedkin began working in Chicago television, and he later directed several nationally broadcast documentaries. In 1967 he moved into film directing with the Sonny-and-Cher musical Good Times, then took on the more-elevated The Birthday Party (1968), a respectable if static adaptation of Harold Pinter’s enigmatic play. Equally ambitious was The Night They Raided Minsky’s (1968), a lively comedy about an innocent Amish girl who becomes a burlesque dancer in 1920s New York City. Friedkin earned generally positive reviews for The Boys in the Band (1970), a controversial drama that presented a frank look at homosexuality. Adapted from Mart Crowley’s 1968 play about gay men at a birthday party, the film featured all the members of the Off-Broadway cast.

The French Connection (1971) provided Friedkin with his first big-budget property. Based on Robin Moore’s best seller about two real-life narcotics cops on the trail of international heroin dealers, the film was a critical and commercial success. It was especially noted for a number of tense action sequences, including a climactic car chase under an elevated train. Friedkin earned an Academy Award for directing, and the film won four other Oscars, including those for best picture and best actor (Gene Hackman).</p></TD>
