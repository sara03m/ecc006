    <DD><h5>Linda Denise Blair (born January 22, 1959) is an American actress and activist. She is best known for playing Regan MacNeil in the horror film The Exorcist (1973), for which she won a Golden Globe Award and received a nomination for an Academy Award. The film established her as a horror icon; she reprised the role in Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977), for which she was nominated for a Saturn Award.

Blair went on to star in numerous television films, such as Born Innocent (1974), Sarah T. – Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic (1975), and Stranger in Our House (1978), before establishing herself as a sex symbol in the romantic musical film Roller Boogie (1979).[3] The 1980s had her starring in numerous horror and exploitation films, including the slasher Hell Night (1981), the prison drama Chained Heat (1983), and the grindhouse cult thriller Savage Streets (1984). Throughout the 1990s, Blair appeared in various independent films and B movies, as well as several television credits. She was the host of the Fox Family reality series Scariest Places on Earth (2001–2003) and had regular appearances on the Animal Planet series Pit Boss (2010–2012).

Asides from her acting credits, Blair has publicly supported various charitable causes, particularly animal rights. In 2004, she founded the Linda Blair WorldHeart Foundation, a non-profit organization which serves to rehabilitate and adopt rescue animals. A vegan, Blair co-authored the book Going Vegan! in 2001</h5>

Born in Los Angeles, DiCaprio began his career by appearing in television commercials in the late 1980s. In the early 1990s, he played recurring roles in various television series, such as the sitcom Parenthood. DiCaprio had his first major film role as Tobias "Toby" Wolff in This Boy's Life (1993). At age 19, he received critical acclaim and first Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance as a developmentally disabled boy Arnie Grape in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), becoming the seventh-youngest nominee in the category. He achieved international stardom in the epic romance Titanic (1997), which became the highest-grossing film to that point. After a few commercially unsuccessful films, DiCaprio starred in two successful features in 2002: the biographical crime drama Catch Me If You Can and the historical drama Gangs of New York, which marked his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese.

DiCaprio portrayed Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) and continued to receive acclaim for his performances in the political thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the crime drama The Departed (2006), and the romantic drama Revolutionary Road (2008).

His accolades include an Academy Award, a BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Golden Globe Award for The Revenant as well as two other Golden Globes for The Aviator and The Wolf of Wall Street.
